# What is git
  Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
# How to start with GIT
1. create dev_dir in your local system
2. Run Command:  
  >>  git init  (Once you will do this , this directory will be tracked by GIT)
3. To test : you can create any file under your created directory
4. >> git status (To check how many files from the local directory it is tracked by git -- Untracked means not added to stage )
5. >> git add [file_name] (Now given file name is added to stage, it is before the commit)
    Note: The git add command move to file from  DEV---> STAGE
